          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
          appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
          equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
          </p>

          <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some
          exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang.
          Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
          begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
          evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
          that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
          faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
          instant.
          </p>

          <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
          the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a
          jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all
          the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not
          missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
          ocean.

          <p>
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
          reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
          that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
          right. Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first
          sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team
          of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian
          Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
          space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a
          universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a
          trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They
          are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
          Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
          </p>
          <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether
          it could ever be proved.</p>
          <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of
          dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space
          and energy to science and speculation.</p>
          <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
          hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture
          and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
          bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
          <p><strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong></p>
          <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach
          of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the
          first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
          should ruffle space-time.</p>
          <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said,
          “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
          <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational
          waves.”</p>
          <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
          space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the
          sun.</p>
          <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
          Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here
          on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
