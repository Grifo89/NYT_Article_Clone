      <h1>The Theory of Inflation</h1>
      <p id="first-overlap">Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the
        universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

        <p class="pp1"><span>THE UNIVERSE</span>is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way
          galaxy, we can
          observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look,
          the
          universe has an even temperature.</p>
        <p class="pp2"><span>NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast
          distance from one side
          of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to
          mix into an
          even temperature.</p>

        <p class="pp3"><span>DISTANT COFFEE</span> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one
          direction. You see a
          coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.</p>
        <p class="pp4"><span>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</span>Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a
          similar coffee cup,
          at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you
          might want
          to look for another explanation.</p>
        <p class="pp5"><span>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from
          place to place before they
          get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time,
          that might
          explain their even temperature.</p>
        <p class="pp6"><span>INFLATION</span> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of
          a second after the
          Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding
          energy field
          eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
        <p class="pp7"><span>FLUCTUATION</span>Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in
          swirls of polarized
          light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are
          gravitational
          waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
        <p class="pp8"><span>EXPANSION</span>Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster
          than light and cooling
          to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe
          mirrors the
          froth and foam of the original pot.</p>
